# `.project-mind` – Project Memory System

This folder is the **second brain** for this project.
It stores **context, decisions, and history** so developers and AI tools can work with full understanding of the codebase.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Keep it updated**

   * When you fix a bug → add it to `notes.md`
   * When you change something major → log it in `history.md`
   * When you make a decision → document it in `decisions.md`

2. **When using AI tools**

   * Always load `ai-memory.md`, `notes.md`, and `history.md` into context
   * Follow `ai-memory.md` conventions to keep output consistent

3. **Before you code**

   * Check `tasks.todo.md` for what’s next
   * Read `notes.md` for gotchas

4. **After you code**

   * Update `history.md` with what you changed and why
   * Move completed tasks from `tasks.todo.md` to “Done” section
